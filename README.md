The solution includes a do-while iteration.
Before the iteration block: the solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.

Inside the iteration block: The solution uses a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user. The solution ensures that the input is a valid representation of an integer. If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, the code uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10. The solution ensures that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
Below (after) the iteration code block: the solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.
