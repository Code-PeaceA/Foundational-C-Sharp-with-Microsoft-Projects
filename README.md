### User Entry Validation - integers
The solution includes a do-while iteration.
Before the iteration block: the solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
Inside the iteration block: The solution uses a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user. The solution ensures that the input is a valid representation of an integer. If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, the code uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10. The solution ensures that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
Below (after) the iteration code block: the solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.
### User Entry Validation - Strings
The solution includes a do-while iteration.
Before the iteration block, the solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for one of three role names: Administrator, Manager, or User.
Inside the iteration block, the solution uses a Console.Readline() statement to obtain input from the user. The solution ensures that the value enteres matches one of the three role options. The solution uses the Trim() and ToLower() methods on the input value to ignore leading and trailing space characters and also ignore case. If the value entered isn't a match for one of the role options, the code uses Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for a valid entry.
Below/after the iteration code block, the solution uses Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.
